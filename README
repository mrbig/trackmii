TrackMii is a head tracking plugin for X-Plane on linux. It uses the wiimote
to capture image data. Lots of the code is basically a Linux/C port of the
opensource Freetrack project. It supports the 3 point cap model, as
described at the Freetrack site.

TrackMii is currently in early development stage. It supports two degrees of
freedom (pitch, yaw), and a user interface to set up smoothing and
translation curves.


  Software requirements
==============================

 * cwiid for communicating with the wiimote
     http://abstrakraft.org/cwiid/
     
 * X-Plane plugin SDK 
     http://www.xsquawkbox.net/xpsdk/mediawiki/Main_Page

 * bluetooth support set up and working


   Hardware requirements:
==============================

 - 3 points cap - refer to Freetrack Handbook how to build one
     http://www.free-track.net/english/freetrack/manuel.php

 - Wiimote


  Compile and install
==============================

TrackMii currently does not have autoconfigure. To compile the X-Plane plugin
at the project directory type:

   make CONF=Plugin

and hopefully you'll get your plugin at dist/Plugin/GNU-Linux-x86/ named
as trackmii_plugin.xpl

Copy this file to the Resources/plugins/ directory of your X-Plane
installation.

TrackMii also has a console test program, if you intend to use the code in
some other applications, you could check the trackmii.c.


  Usage
==============================

      Connecting

TrackMii plugin tries to connect to the Wiimote immediately as the simulator
starts up, so it is a good idea to put the Wiimote into discoverable mode
right before you start X-Plane. The easiest way is to push 1+2 at the same
time. You'll see the blue leds blinking. When the plugin is connected the
leds one and four will be lit up, this means you're good to go.

      Setup

In the simulator you can access the setup under the Plugins->TrackMii menu.
The setup window you are able to set the smoothing globally, and the
responsivity for each axes.

Smoothing is the value that controls how fast the simulator will react on
head movement. The larger the value, the slower the little movements will be
tracked.

For both axes (yaw, pitch) you can set the following values:

 * deadzone: the size of the area where we treat the head as centered

 * response: curvature of the translation function. It's like the function 
             that you can use for joystick responsivity. Left most value
             means linear response, rightmost means most nonlinear.

 * amplification: how much we'll amplify your head movement. This makes it
             possible to see the monitor even when you want to look back in
             the simulator.

If you were not able to connect the Wiimote on start up, you can do this also
in this setup window.

      Using in game

To turn head tracking on and off you'll need to assign it to a button, or
key. Go to Settings->Joystick & Equipment menu. Use the "Buttons Adv" panel
to assign it to a joystick button, or "Keys" pane to assign it to a keyboard
shortcut.

To select the TrackMii command, you should click the checkbox on the top
middle part of the window (left of the text input field). In the X System
folder select trackmii/operation/toggle_tracking.

When all done, you can turn the head tracking on and off with your desired
command. Turning it on will take you to the virtual cockpit immediately.

If you experience problems, try to turn on the debugging window in the
plugin setup menu. Here you can check the state of the connection, and how
many of the infrared leds are seen by the Wiimote. If it's less the three,
then head tracking won't work.
