Trackmii is a head tracking plugin for X-Plane on linux. It uses the wiimote
to capture image data. Lots of the code is basically a Linux/C port of the
opensource Freetrack project. It supports the 3 point cap modell, as
described at the Freetrack site.

Trackmii is currently in early development stage. It supports two degrees of
freedom (pitch, yaw), and a user interface to set up smoothing and
translation curves.

Software requirements:
 - cwiid for communicating with the wiimote
